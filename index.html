                <p>ESTUPENDO is a community group for Manchester residents looking to start or continue learning the Spanish language and/or culture. We organise weekly meetups where members can meet and mingle with others interested in learning Spanish, along with Hispanic and Latin members of the community.</p>
                <p>Meetups take place in casual settings in the city centre, and consist of a variety of fun and engaging social activities. Or, you could just sit and have a drink. </p>

                <p id="quote">"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."</p><p>We are firm believers that studying a foreign language is one of the most enriching hobbies a person can have. At ESTUPENDO, we aim to provide a platform for anyone of any age and skill level to broaden their horizons and learn to speak Spanish.</p>
